--- Bank Account System Instructions ---

This is a simple bank account management system. The user can perform various actions such as creating an account, 
depositing money, withdrawing money, transferring money, deleting an account, and checking the balance. 
The data is stored in individual .txt files, where each account's data is kept.

Follow these steps to use the system:

1. Run the Python script. You will see a menu with the following options:
   1. Create Account
   2. Deposit Money
   3. Withdraw Money
   4. Transfer Money
   5. Delete Account
   6. Check Account Balance
   7. Exit

2. Choose the desired option by entering the corresponding number.

3. For each operation:
   - **Create Account**: Enter a new account number, the account holder's name, and an initial balance.
   - **Deposit Money**: Enter the account number and the amount to deposit.
   - **Withdraw Money**: Enter the account number and the amount to withdraw.
   - **Transfer Money**: Enter the sender account number, receiver account number, and the amount to transfer.
   - **Delete Account**: Enter the account number to delete (this will reset the balance to zero).
   - **Check Account Balance**: Enter the account number to view the balance.

4. The account data is stored in a .txt file named after the account number (e.g., 101.txt).

5. The program will keep running until you select option 7 to exit.

6. Make sure to provide valid inputs for each option to avoid errors.

--- System Design ---
- **File-Based Storage**: The system uses individual .txt files for each account, where the account number is the filename.
- **Account Management**: All account actions (create, deposit, withdraw, transfer, delete) update the corresponding .txt file.
- **Persistence**: Data is retained between program executions.

--- For Developers ---
- You can extend this system by adding more features like logging, error handling, or switching to a database for data storage.
- This code can be adapted to work with web frameworks like Flask or Django to create a full-stack application.
