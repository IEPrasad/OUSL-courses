## 📝 Introduction

**Data Structures:** Organized formats to store and manage data efficiently (e.g., arrays, linked lists, trees).

**Algorithms:** Step-by-step procedures to solve computational problems (e.g., searching, sorting).

Efficient code requires the right combination of data structures and algorithms.

## 🔧 Basic Data Structures

### 📦 Arrays

- Fixed-size collection of elements of the same type.
- Fast access with index `O(1)`.
- Example:

```c
int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
