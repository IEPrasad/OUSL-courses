Answer for the EEX 3266 - 2.5 Activity

1).  List down five open-source DBMSs and their application environment
	1- MySQL
	2- PostgreSQL
	3- SQLite
	4- MongoDB
	5- MariaDB

2).  List down at least three single-user DBMSs
	1- MS Access
	2- SQLite
	3- FileMaker

3) What are the five major parts of a database system?
	1- Data 
	2- Database Mangement System (DBMS)
	3- Hardware 
	4- Software
	5- Users

4)  Why is a spreadsheet NOT a database?

	** A spreadsheet is not a database, because it dosen't have a proper structure or proper oraganization, 
	concurrent access and robust data integrity as in a database. 
	So it cannot be a database. 

5) Discuss the functions of each layer in the 'three-tierâ€™ database architecture, 
	 and define the necessary tools involved

	1- Presentation Tier 
		** Function: Manage the user interface and facilitates interaction between users and the application or that system.

		** Tools: HTML CSS JavaScript, Graphical User Interfaces, or user interfaces built with a React or Vue.js,
		or web browsers, mobile apps, desktop applications 

	2. Application Tier 
		** Function: Manges business logics and application processes.
			Applies business rules and validations.
		
		** Tools: Sever side scripting languages (Java, Python, C#), Sever side frameworks (Django, Spring, Express.js)

	3. Data Tier
		** Function: Store and retireve dats.
		** Tools: Database Management Systems. (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle).
				
6). How is a conceptual design different from a logical design?

		** Conceptual Design: 
				- Defines entities, relationships, and high-level structures without specific technical details 
				but 
		** Logical Design: 
				- Trnaslate conceptual design into more detailed structure, specifying data types and keys and relationships. 
		
7).  Compare and contrast between external view and conceptual view

		** External View 
	
Focus: Specific user need and tasks.

Users: Specific user groups or applications.

Customization: Multiple views tailored to different user needs and exist.

Details: Shows only relevent data for specific fucntions.

Changes: Easy to modify


		** Conceptual view

Focus: Overall data structure and relationships between entities.

Users: Database administrators and developers.

Uniqueness: Single, global view representing the entire database structure.

Details: Shows a good picture of data entities and their relationships.

Changes: Changes affeting how users see things and need to be carefull to prevent mistakes.

------->>> 
Analogy : 
	We can understand the differece between External view and Conceptual view by this example.

		** External view is like looking at a resturant menu that only shows lunch options.
		** Conceptual view is like having the entire recipe book with all the recipes.

08).  Which level of the database architecture does the database administrator work with?

		** Physical level.

09).  Which level of the database architecture does the application programmer work with?

		** External level.

10).  What is logical data independence and why is it important?
