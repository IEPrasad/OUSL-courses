Answer for the EEX 3266 - 2.5 Activity

1).  List down five open-source DBMSs and their application environment
	1- MySQL
	2- PostgreSQL
	3- SQLite
	4- MongoDB
	5- MariaDB

2).  List down at least three single-user DBMSs
	1- MS Access
	2- SQLite
	3- FileMaker

3) What are the five major parts of a database system?
	1- Data 
	2- Database Mangement System (DBMS)
	3- Hardware 
	4- Software
	5- Users

4)  Why is a spreadsheet NOT a database?

	** A spreadsheet is not a database, because it dosen't have a proper structure or proper oraganization, 
	concurrent access and robust data integrity as in a database. 
	So it cannot be a database. 

5) Discuss the functions of each layer in the 'three-tierâ€™ database architecture, 
	 and define the necessary tools involved

	1- Presentation Tier 
		** Function: Manage the user interface and facilitates interaction between users and the application or that system.

		** Tools: HTML CSS JavaScript, Graphical User Interfaces, or user interfaces built with a React or Vue.js,
		or web browsers, mobile apps, desktop applications 

	2. Application Tier 
		** Function: Manges business logics and application processes.
			Applies business rules and validations.
		
		** Tools: Sever side scripting languages (Java, Python, C#), Sever side frameworks (Django, Spring, Express.js)

	3. Data Tier
		** Function: Store and retireve dats.
		** Tools: Database Management Systems. (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle).
				
6). How is a conceptual design different from a logical design?

		** Conceptual Design: 
				- Defines entities, relationships, and high-level structures without specific technical details 
				but 
		** Logical Design: 
				- Trnaslate conceptual design into more detailed structure, specifying data types and keys and relationships. 
		
7).  Compare and contrast between external view and conceptual view

		** External View 
	
Focus: Specific user need and tasks.

Users: Specific user groups or applications.

Customization: Multiple views tailored to different user needs and exist.

Details: Shows only relevent data for specific fucntions.

Changes: Easy to modify


		** Conceptual view

Focus: Overall data structure and relationships between entities.

Users: Database administrators and developers.

Uniqueness: Single, global view representing the entire database structure.

Details: Shows a good picture of data entities and their relationships.

Changes: Changes affeting how users see things and need to be carefull to prevent mistakes.

------->>> 
Analogy : 
	We can understand the differece between External view and Conceptual view by this example.

		** External view is like looking at a resturant menu that only shows lunch options.
		** Conceptual view is like having the entire recipe book with all the recipes.

08).  Which level of the database architecture does the database administrator work with?

		** Physical level.

09).  Which level of the database architecture does the application programmer work with?

		** External level.

10).  What is logical data independence and why is it important?

		** The ability to change the logical schema, without changing the external schema or user view,
		is called "logical data independence".

		** Allows altering the database structure without breaking existing applications or user interfaces.
		

11).  Explain the difference between external, internal, and conceptual schemas. How are these 
			different schema layers related to the concepts of logical and physical data independence?

		** External Schema 
				- Represents user view.
				- Concerned with logical data independence.

		** Conceptual Schema
				- Describe overall structure.
				- Allows to logical data independence.

		** Internal Schema
				- Deals with physical storeage.
				- Ensures physical data independence.

		Logical Data Independence
			** Modifies logical schema.
			** No impact on external views.

		Physical Data Independence
			** Modifies physical schema.
			** No impact on logical or external views.


12).  Explain the basic features of relational database model. Define if there are any emerging 
    	database models apart from relational databases?

		** Features of relational database model.
				. Tables with rows and columns
				. Primary keys for unique identification
				. Normalization for data intergrity
				. SQL for defining and querying 

		** NoSQL Database: Flexible for unstrucured data.(MongoDB)
		** Graph Database: Designed for complex relationship data.
		** Document Stores: Store data in document format
				(MongoDB)
	
13). What does the acronym SDLC mean?
			** Software development life cycle.

14). Explain in details the steps involved in Database Life Cycle.

Requirements: 
	* Identify user needs and sytem requirements for the database

Analysis:
	* Analyze data and processes, defining relationships and constraints.

Design: 
	* Create a blueprint for the database, specifying tables, keys and structures.

Implementation:
	* Develop the database according to the design using a chosen DBMS.

Testing:
	* Validate the database for accuracy, performance, and security.

Maintenance:
	* Regularly update, enhance, and optimize the database to meet evoling needs.


15). What are the disadvantages of using waterfall model?

-Rigidity:	
	* Limited adaptability.

- Limited User involvement 
- Late Visibility of Product 
- No partial deliverables
- Challenging in handling changes and uncertainties.
- Testing deferred until project completion.
