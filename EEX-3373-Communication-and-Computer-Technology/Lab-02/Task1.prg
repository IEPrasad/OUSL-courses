Lab Task 1:

Draw a flowchart to demonstrate the process of adding two numbers.Write an assembly language
program for the above algorithm.

● you have to add the last two digits from your s number (if it is zero you can consider value as 9)
● First you have to load value to the accumulator.
● You must follow similar steps as given above in Example 1.
● After executing the program observe the value in “acc”.
● Store the result in 0x84 memory location


my s numbe 23010155

last two digits are 5 and 5

laddacc #5
add #5
storeacc 0x84 // immediate addressing mode
