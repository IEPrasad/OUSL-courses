    Inner Classes
        Static inner classes
        Non-static inner classes
    Enums
        Defining and using enumerations

4. Exception Handling

    Try-Catch Blocks
        Basic try-catch-finally
        Nested try-catch
    Throw and Throws
        Custom exceptions
        Checked vs unchecked exceptions

5. Collections Framework

    List, Set, and Map Interfaces
        ArrayList, LinkedList
        HashSet, TreeSet
        HashMap, TreeMap
    Iterators
        For-each loop
        Using Iterator

6. File I/O

    Reading and Writing Files
        FileReader, BufferedReader
        FileWriter, BufferedWriter
    Serialization
        ObjectInputStream and ObjectOutputStream

7. Multithreading

    Creating Threads
        Implementing Runnable
        Extending Thread class
    Thread Synchronization
        Synchronized methods and blocks
        wait() and notify()

8. Generics

    Generic Classes
        Defining generic types
    Bounded Generics
        Upper and lower bounds

9. JavaFX (Optional - GUI Programming)

    Basic GUI Components
        Buttons, TextFields, Labels
    Event Handling
        Action events

        HBox, VBox, GridPane

10. Java Standard Library

    Utility Classes
        String manipulation
        Math, Random
    Date and Time
        LocalDate, LocalTime, DateTimeFormatter

11. Best Practices

    Design Patterns
        Singleton, Factory, Observer
    Code Readability and Maintainability
        Proper use of comments
        Code formatting

12. Build Tools and Version Control

    Maven/Gradle (for project management)
    Git (for version control)

Suggested Learning Path:

    Start with basics: syntax, control structures, and data types.
    Move into OOP fundamentals: master classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism.
    Learn advanced OOP topics: interfaces, abstraction, exception handling.
    Explore collections: focus on lists, sets, and maps.
    Dive into multithreading and file I/O.
    Practice with real-world projects.
