Exceptions 

An exception is a problem that occurs during program execution. Exceptions cause abnormal termination of the program.
Exception handling is powerful mechanism that handles runtime errors to maintain normal application flow.

An exception can occur for many different reasons. Some examples:
  - A user has entered invalid data
  - A file that needs to be opened cannot be found
  - A network connection has been lost in the middle of communications.
  - Insufficient memory and other issues related to physical resources.


  As you can see, exceptions are caused by user error, programmer error, or physical resource issues. However, a well-written program should handle all possible exceptions.

  try {
  //some code
} catch (Exception e) {
  //some code to handle errors
}
