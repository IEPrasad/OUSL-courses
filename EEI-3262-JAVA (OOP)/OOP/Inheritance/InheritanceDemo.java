/*
Inheritance in Java
  Inheritance is an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concept where one class (child or subclass) acquires the properties (fields) and methods of another class (parent or superclass). It allows for reuse of existing code, reducing redundancy and improving maintainability.

/*
Key Points About Inheritance

Purpose of Inheritance:
  Reuse common code across classes.
  Establish a relationship between classes (IS-A relationship).
  Enable polymorphism, where a subclass can override the behavior of a parent class.

Terminology:
  Superclass: The parent class providing the common behavior and properties.
  Subclass: The child class that inherits from the superclass.

How to Implement Inheritance in Java:
  Use the extends keyword to define a subclass.
  The subclass inherits all public and protected members of the superclass.

Types of Inheritance in Java:
  Single Inheritance: One subclass inherits from one superclass.
  Multilevel Inheritance: A subclass inherits from a superclass, and another class inherits from this subclass.
  Hierarchical Inheritance: Multiple subclasses inherit from one superclass.
  (Note: Java does not support multiple inheritance with classes to avoid ambiguity, but it allows it with interfaces.)
