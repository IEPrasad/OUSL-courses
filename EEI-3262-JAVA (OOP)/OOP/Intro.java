1. What is OOP?
  Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which
  can contain ata in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties) and code 
  in the form of methods (functions). OOP helps to organize software design in a more modular
  and reusable way.
