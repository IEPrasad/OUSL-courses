    b) Name five (5) different form elements and their description.
    c) Name the five (5) categories of CSS selector with examples.
    d) What are the three (3) ways of inserting CSS into a web page? And given an example for each

    a) == (Equality)
      * Compares values only, performing type conversion if necessary.
        Ex: 5 == "5" -- > true
      
       == (Strict Equality)
      ** Compares both value and type without type conversion.
        Ex: 5 === "5" -- > false

    1. <input>: Collects user input (text, number, email, etc.).
    
    2. <textarea>: Multi-line text input field.

    3. <select>: Dropdown menu for selecting options.

    4. <button>: Clickable button for form submission or actions.

    5. <label>: Descriptive text linked to form controls.

    
    c) Five Categories of CSS Selectors with Examples

    1. Universal Selector: Targets all elements.
      Example: * { margin: 0; }
    
    2. Type Selector: Targets specific HTML elements.
      Example: p { color: blue; }

    3. Class Selector: Targets elements with a specific class.
      Example: .header { font-size: 20px }
    
    4. ID Selector: Targets an element with a specific ID.
      Example: #main { padding: 10px }
