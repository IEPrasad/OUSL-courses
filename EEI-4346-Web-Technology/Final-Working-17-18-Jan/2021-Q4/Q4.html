<!-- 
AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML 

  ** Ajax is a web development technique used to create interactive and dynamic web applications

  ** Ajax is not a programming language or a technology itself, but a 
  combination of existing technologies

  ** It enables asynchronous communication between the browser and the server without reloading the entire web page

  ** Ajax allows updating parts of a web page with new data, improving 
  user experience and responsiveness

-->

<!-- 
How Does AJAX Work?

  ** Ajax uses a combination of JavaScript, XML (or JSON), and XMLHttpRequest object

  ** JavaScript is used to make asynchronous requests to the server

  ** XMLHttpRequest object is responsible for handling the communication with the server

  ** XML or JSON is commonly used to format the data send and received 
  between the browser and the server

-->

<!-- 
1. An event occurs in a web page (the page is loaded; a button is clicked)

2. An XMLHttpRequest object is created by JavaScript 

3. An XMLHttpRequest object sends a request object sends a request to a web sever 

4. The sever process the request

5. The server sends a response back to the web page 

6. The response is read by JavaScript 

7. Proper action (like page update) is performed by JavaScript
