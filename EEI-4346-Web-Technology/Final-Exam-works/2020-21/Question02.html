  b. Name five (5) different form elements and their description.
  c. Name the five (5) categories of CSS selector with examples.
  d. What are the three (3) ways of inserting CSS into a web page? And give an example for each.


a. What is the difference between == and === ?

  ** == (Loose equality): It compares values for equality, but if coerces (converts) data types if necessary.

    ** Example: "5" == 5 --> true (because both are considered equal after type conversion)

  ** === (Strict equality): It compares both the value and the type without type coercion.

    ** Example: "5" === 5 --> false (because the types are different, one is a string and the other is a number)

                  ------------------

b. Name five (5) different form elements and their description.

  1. <input>: A versatile element used to create various form controls such as text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, etc.

  2. <textarea>: A large input field used for multi-line text input, like comments or messages.

  3. <select>: A drop-down menu for selecting options. Typically used with <option> element.
  
  4. <button>: A clickable button that can be used to submit forms or trigger actions. 

  5. <label>: A label for an input element, often used for accessibility and user interface clarity.

                  ------------------

c. Name the five (5) categories of CSS selector with examples.

    1. Universal Selector ( * ):
        ** Targets al elements on the page.
        ** Example: * { color: red; }

    2. Type Selector (Element Selector):
        ** Targets all elements of a specific type.
        ** Example: p { font-sizeL 16px } (Target all <p> elements)

    3. Class Selector ( . ):
        ** Targets elements with a specific class attribute.
        ** Example: .header { background-color: blue;} (Targets elements with class="header")
      
    4. ID Selector ( # ):
        ** Targets an element with a specific ID.
        ** Example: #main { margin: 20px } (Targets the element with id="main")

    5. Attribute Selector ( [] ):
        ** Targets elements based on an attribute or its value.
        ** Example: input[type="text"] { border: 1px solid black; } (Targets <input> element with type="Text")

d. What are the three (3) ways of inserting CSS into a web page? and give an example for each.

    1. Inline CSS
        ** CSS is applied directly within the style attribute of an HTML element.
        ** Example: <p style="color: red;">This is a red paragraph.</p>

    2. Internal CSS
        ** CSS is written inside the <style> tag in the <head> section of the HTML document.
        ** Example: 
          <style>
            p { color: green; }  
          </style>
    
    3. External CSS:
        ** CSS is placed in a separate .css file and linked to the HTML document using the <link> tag.

        ** Example: <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css">
