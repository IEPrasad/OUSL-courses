III. Consider an array of x number of elements, 8-bit binary numbers Arr[x]. The array numbers start
from Arr[0], and end from Arr[x-1].
 Initialize the Arr[x] with a set of integers.(You can assign x , 11>x>5).
 Assume that the array Arr[ x] data are start to store from the memory address 7516 (0x75).
 Loop through each element in the Arr[x] to get the Sum and store it in the 0x87 memory
location. Calculate the average, avg_Arr[x] of the Arr[x] and store it in the 0x88 memory
location.
 If L- avg_Arr[] = 0 load accumulator with value L (L =First digit of your S-number) and store it
in 0x90 memory location.
 If L< avg_Arr[] load accumulator with value M (M =Second digit of your S-number) and store
it in 0x91 memory location.
 If L> avg_Arr[] load accumulator with value N (N=Third digit of your S-number) and store it in
0x92 memory location.


write a ALP for this task ! 
(it's literally hard, but try to do this how ever !)
