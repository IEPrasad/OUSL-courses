[05 Marks]


1- ** Web programming, also known as scripting, can be divided into two broad categories: Client-side scripting and Server-side scripting.

    Client-side scripting: This type of scripting runs on the user's browser. It is primarily used to create interactive features on web pages, like form validation, animations, and dynamic content updates without reloading the page. An example is JavaScript, which is widely used for tasks like form validation and manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM).

    Server-side scripting: This scripting runs on the server and is used to manage data and handle the backend of a website. It can interact with databases, manage sessions, and control access to resources. Examples include PHP, which is used for creating dynamic web pages, and Python with frameworks like Django or Flask for web development.



2 ** 2. Importance of Copyrights and Privacy Policies:

When working in web development, considering Copyrights and Privacy Policies is essential:

    Copyrights protect the original content created by others, such as images, text, and software. If you use copyrighted materials without permission, you could face legal action, including fines or your website being taken down.

    Privacy Policies ensure that users' personal data is collected, stored, and used in a way that complies with regulations like GDPR. If you don't follow these rules, you could face legal penalties and damage to your reputation.

Disadvantages of not following these rules:

    Legal consequences: You could be sued for violating copyright laws or privacy regulations.
    Loss of user trust: Users may avoid your site if they feel their privacy is not protected or if they notice unlicensed use of content.



3. ** 3. Hypertext Documents:

Hypertext is a system where electronic documents are connected through hyperlinks. Each hyperlink can lead to another document, allowing users to navigate between different pieces of content seamlessly.

How it works:

    Structure: A hypertext document typically includes text, images, and links. When a user clicks on a link, the browser sends a request to the server to retrieve the linked document.

    Functionality: For example, in an HTML document, hyperlinks are created using the <a> tag, and when clicked, they direct the user to another page or section within the same document. This creates a web of interconnected documents, enhancing the user's ability to access related information quickly.



4. ** 4. Open Systems Interconnection Model (OSI):

The OSI Model is a conceptual framework used to understand and implement networking protocols. It divides the process of network communication into seven distinct layers:

    >> Physical Layer: Deals with the physical connection between devices.
    
    >> Data Link Layer: Ensures data transfer between two devices on the same network.
    
    >> Network Layer: Manages data routing and forwarding.
    
    >> Transport Layer: Ensures reliable data transfer.
    
    >> Session Layer: Manages sessions or connections between applications.
    
    >> Presentation Layer: Translates data formats and encrypts/decrypts information.
    
    >> Application Layer: Provides network services directly to the end-user applications.

Importance:

    It standardizes network communication and allows different systems to communicate with each other efficiently.
    Helps in troubleshooting by isolating issues to a specific layer.


5. ** 5. SQL Injection and Its Prevention:

SQL Injection is a type of web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with the queries that an application makes to its database. By inserting malicious SQL code into an input field, an attacker can access, modify, or delete database content.

Prevention Methods:

    Parameterized Queries: Use prepared statements with parameterized queries, which ensures that user input is treated as data and not executable code.
    Input Validation: Validate and sanitize user inputs to prevent the execution of harmful SQL code.



   ------------------------------------------


   Answers for the first question in briefly 

1. Categories of Scripting:

    Client-side scripting: Runs on the user's browser (e.g., JavaScript). Used for interactive features like form validation.
    Server-side scripting: Runs on the server (e.g., PHP). Manages data and backend processes.

2. Importance of Copyrights and Privacy Policies:

    Copyrights: Protects original content. Violations can lead to legal issues.
    Privacy Policies: Ensure user data is handled legally. Non-compliance can result in penalties.

Disadvantages:

    Legal consequences.
    Loss of user trust.

3. Hypertext Documents:

    Hypertext: Electronic documents connected via hyperlinks.
    Functionality: Links in HTML (<a> tag) connect to other documents or sections, enabling easy navigation.

4. OSI Model:

    OSI Model: 7 layers that standardize network communication, from Physical (Layer 1) to Application (Layer 7).
    Importance: Ensures efficient communication and helps with troubleshooting.

5. SQL Injection and Prevention:

    SQL Injection: A security flaw where attackers inject malicious SQL into queries.
    Prevention: Use parameterized queries and input validation.

Question 02 (Marks 20)


1. Explore how web hosting services enable individuals and organizations to make their websites accessible to users worldwide [06 Marks]

2. Explore how domain names serve as unique identifiers for websites and play a crucial role in branding, credibility, and memorability
[06 Marks]

3. Explore the various HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) and their purposes in web communication.
[08 Marks]




1. Web Hosting Services:
	** Web hosting services store website files on servers, 
	making them accessible on the internet.

	** they provide the necessary infrastructure, such as 
	storage bandwidth, and security, to ensure website are 
	available to users globally.

2. Domain Names:
	** Domain names are unique website addresses that simplify 
	access and contribute to branding.

	** They enhance a website's credibility and are easier for 
	users to remember compared to IP addresses.

3. HTTP Methods:

	GET: Retrieves data from a server.
	POST: Submits data to a server for processing.
	PUT: Updates existing resources on a server.
	Delete: Removes resources from a server.


-------------------------

Question 03 

1. Using JavaScript Loop (for/ while) write a program the
counts of even numbers when the starting and ending are given 
by the user. (Ex: Start No: 1, End No: 8, Counts of Even 
number: 4)



<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <title>Question 3-1</title>
</head>
<body>
  <script>
    let StartNo = parseInt(prompt("Start No:"));
    let EndNo = parseInt(prompt("End No:"));
    let count = 0;

    for (let i = StartNo; i <= EndNo; i++) {
      if (i % 2 == 0) {
        count += 1;
      }
    }

    console.log(`Counts of Even Number:${count}`);

  </script>
</body>
</html>
