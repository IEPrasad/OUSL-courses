        <div class="details">
          Industrial activities in Sri Lanka contribute to water pollution through the discharge of untreated or inadequately treated wastewater, known as industrial effluents, into water bodies such as rivers, lakes, and coastal areas. These effluents contain various pollutants, including heavy metals, toxic chemicals, and organic compounds, which can harm aquatic ecosystems and threaten public health.

              <li><span class="high-lighter">Industrial Accidents:</span> Spills and leaks from industrial facilities can release large quantities of pollutants into water bodies</li>
              <li><span class="high-lighter">Improper Waste Management</span>: Poor handling and disposal of industrial waste, including hazardous materials, leads to water pollution via runoff and leaching into waterways.</li>

          Air pollution from vehicle emissions is a pressing environmental and public health issue in Sri Lanka, particularly in urban areas with high vehicle density. The combustion of fossil fuels in vehicles releases a variety of pollutants into the atmosphere, contributing to poor air quality and posing serious health risks to the population.
