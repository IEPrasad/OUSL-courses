        <div class="intro">

        <p>A healthy development in the present-day Sri Lankan scenario of public opinion is the increasing concern with which environmental issues are discussed in all strata of society.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>From the early sixties, preservation and amelioration of the environment has risen in the rating of national priorities to such an extent that it is very seldom people of Sri Lanka discuss development without referring to the environmental issues in the same breath.</li>
          <li>This is a very encouraging situation, because the sustenance and preservation of a civilized society ultimately binds with the conservation and judicious utilization of the natural resources of its land, water, air, and vegetation.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>It is with this national aspiration and outlook that we focus attention on the resources and environment of Jaffna District.</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>Geographically, historically, and culturally, Jaffna has its own peculiarities in comparison with other districts.</li>
          <li>The district, often described as the Land of Singing Fish, granary of the East and the land of milk and honey, today stands at the threshold of degradation of its environment.</li>
          <li>Thick forest reserves, rich with countless species of fauna and flora, blue lagoons with lush green mangroves, spotlessly clean beaches and numerous bird sanctuaries which the district has all along been famous for, are today, slowly but surely being exploited and mismanaged beyond tolerable limits.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As a result, there is now a tremendous amount of interest among the people of Jaffna, especially the intelligentsia and the younger generation, to preserve the heritage and the natural resources of the district.</p>
        <ul><li>
          They are living to the fact that destruction of their environment will have a differential impact, in that, it affects the poor and the powerless more than the rich and the powerful.
        </li></ul>
        <p>The information for preparation of this profile were collected from such enthusiastic citizens.</p>
        <ul><li>
          The interest and support extended by them exhibit their dedication, concern and willingness to share their experience and knowledge.
        </li></ul>
        <p>In the ensuing chapters, the Profile gives a general historical background of the District in context with its geography and climatic pattern.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The human and natural resources, infrastructure of the State Administration, physical characteristics, hazards caused to the environment by nature and human activity etc., are discussed in detail.</li>
          <li>The present methods of environmental protection are analyzed, and proposals for improvements for sustainable development and environmental management are made.</li>

      <h2 class="about-topic">About page</h2>
      <p>
        Eco Serendib has engaged an estimated 10 thousand volunteers , making it one of the largest</br>
community-based environmental campaigns in the country. Community groups, schools,</br>
businesses, and local governments join as Members and carry out activities that address local</br>
environmental issues.
By facilitating local action Eco Serendib brings about global environmental change.

          Eco Serendib was established in 1993 and is a not-for-profit, non-government apolitical event
that unites communities with a common focus to protect the environment. We support local
groups and organizations to plan and conduct various activities to clean up, fix up and conserve
the environment

      <h2>Eco Issues</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>Problems arising out of Human Activites

        </li>
      </ul>

      <div class="problems-describe">
        <h3>Destruction of coral reef</h3>
        <div>Coral reefs abound on the coast of the district. They are the habitats of the beautiful
          coral fish communities and also the home of migrants from deeper regions of the
          sea. Young forms, which are liberated during the breeding of animals living with the
          coral, form an important food supply of other fishes. Coral lobsters also form solid
          barrier for the coastal line against the eroding nature of the sea. It is a pity that
          destruction of this natural coastal protection is rampant in the District</div>
      </div>

      <div class="problems-describe">
        <h3>Destruction of Mangroves</h3>
        <div>With the forests receding towards the western boundary, the mangroves along the
          shores of the lagoons and "THONAS" of the District have become the main
          source of fire wood for domestic energy. Destruction of mangroves is almost
          complete on the eastern shore of Jaffna lagoon</div>
      </div>

      <div class="problems-describe">
        <h3>Use of Chemical Fertilizers</h3>
        <div>The topographical and drainage pattern of the District is such that almost all the
          drainage lines end up in the lagoons. This includes drainage water from the paddy
          fields as well. In recent years there has been excessive use of chemical fertilizers in
          paddy fields, which find their way to the lagoons. The presence of chemical fertilizers
          in the water courses, beyond tolerable limits could be harmful to the aquatic life.</div>
      </div>

      <div class="problems-describe">
        <h3>Floods</h3>
        <div>Deforestation and drainage patterns, more than the intensity of the rainfall it receives,
          are the main causes of floods in the District. Floods cause environmental problems in
          the district when rivers and lagoons outflank, spread sand over agricultural lands,
          destroy vegetation, inject salinity into lands bordering the lagoons and damage houses
          and property. Deaths, loss of animals and poultry are reported after each flood.</div>
      </div>

      <div class="problems-describe">
        <h3>Coastal Erosion</h3>
        <div>Coastal Erosion in the District is not a natural hazard: It takes places only where the
          protective coral reefs are removed.</div>
      </div>

    <div class="reconmendations">
      <h2>Recommendations</h2>

      <div class="reco-first">
        The solution to these problems is tackled better by bringing the environmental
issues to the grass root level and involve the public deeper in problems of their
respective areas. The following recommendations could improve the methods
that are already being adopted for environmental protection and management.
      </div>

      <div class="recos">
        Environmental Advisory Committees should be set up at hamlet level with the
Grama Seva Niladharis as their Chairman. This will enable increased participation
of people at the grass root level. The people will be more free to air their views on
environmental issue in their respective areas and a sense of responsibility will be
created in them to protect their environment.
      </div>
      <div class="recos">
        Periodical seminars and workshops should be conducted by the G.A. to appraise
        the field officers and Grama Seva Niladharis on environmental issues. Their
        knowledge in environmental management, particularly in agro forestry, soil
        conservation, water management, coastal protection and disaster preparedness
        should be updated.
      </div>
      <div class="recos">
        Evidently, the above proposals are based on a "bottom up approach" and hence
bound to create not only an awareness on the environmental issues, but also
create a wide based responsibility towards environmental protection and
management in the District.
