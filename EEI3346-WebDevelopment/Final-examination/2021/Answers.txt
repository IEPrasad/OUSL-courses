Question 2

a) Web application have gradually evolved from static to dynamic nature keeping 
in view the needs of the potential users and advancement in technology. It is 
important to follow a systemic approach for the development of websites. 
	List the main phases of the Web engineering process model 

		** Planning 
		** Design 
		** Development 
		** Testing 
		** Deployment 
		** Maintenance and updating 

b) What is the difference between frontend and backend web development ?
	
	** Front-End
		-- Focuses on the user interface and experience, using 
		HTMLm CSS and JavaScript to create visually appealing 
		and interactive elements.

	** Back-End 
		-- Handles server-side logic, database, and application 
		functionality, using languages like PHP, Python, and 
		others to mange data and server communication. 


c) i) Explain the term, Computer Network?	
   ii) List some advantages and disadvantages of using Fiber 
   Optic cable?

   i) ** Computer Network:
   A system of interconnected devices that communicate and 
   share resources, such as data and hardware, using wired or 
   wireless connections.


   ii) ** Fiber Optic Cable:

  	Advantages:
  		** High speed and bandwidth
  		** Long-distance transmission without signal loss
  		** Immune to electromagnetic interference. 

  	Disadvantages:
  		** Expensive to install 
  		** Fragile and difficult to repair
  		** Complex installation process 


d) i) Explain how does a Web browser work?
   ii) What is HTTP? Briefly explain the anatomy of HTTP?

i) How a Web Browser Works:

** A web browser sends a request to a server for a specific 
webpage. The server process this request and sends back the 
webpage data, which the browser then displays to the user. 


ii) What is HTTPS?:
	
	HTTP (Hyper Transfer Protocol) is a used for transferring 
	web pages over the internet. It operates through requests
	(from the client) and responses (from the server). The
	anatomy of HTTP includes methods (like GET, POST), headers
	(metadata about the request/response), and the body 
	(content being transferred).


	briefly ---->>

	i) Web Browser: Sends a request to a server and displays 
	the webpage returned.

	ii) HTTP: A protocol for transferring web pages, using 
	requests (like GET, HEAD, POST) and responses between 
	client and server.



** Internet is global network of interconnected computers and 
servers that communicate using standardized protocols. 
like (TCP/ IP).

Question 3)

a) Explain the use of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and their importance
in web development.

	** HTML - Defines the structure and content of a webpage,

	** Writing, testing, and debugging code.
	** Optimizing website performance.
	** Collaborate with designers and stakeholders.

c) In which stage do you use XML in web development?
	
	** XML is used in the "Development" stage or data 
	exchange and configuration. It may also be used during 
	"Maintenance" for updates and modifications.


d) Mention some tips you can use to reduce the load time of a 
web application that you have written ?

	** Optimize Images
	** Minify Code 
	** Use Caching: Store frequently accessed data loacally.
	** Enable Compression 
	** Reduce HTTP Requests: Combine files and use CSS sprites.
	** Implement Lazy Loading: Load images and content only 
	when needed.


e) List two(2) latest web development tools you can use?
	
	** VS Code: Lightweight code editor with extensions and 
	debugging. 
	** Webpack: JavaScripit bundler for optimizing assets.
