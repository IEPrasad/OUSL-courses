Web development typically follows several stages. Here are the main stages:
1. Planning

    Objective Definition: Define the purpose and goals of the website.
    Requirements Gathering: Identify the target audience and their needs.
    Scope Definition: Determine the features and functionalities.
    Resource Allocation: Identify the development cost and resources required (developers, designers, tools, etc.).
    Timeline Establishment: Set milestones and deadlines.

2. Design

    Wireframing: Create basic layouts to show structure and navigation.
    Mockups: Develop detailed designs with colors, fonts, and graphics.
    User Experience (UX): Focus on the overall user experience, ensuring ease of use and accessibility.
    User Interface (UI): Design the visual elements of the application.

3. Development

    Front-end Development: Coding the user-facing part of the website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and relevant frameworks.
    Back-end Development: Building the server-side logic, database interactions, and APIs.
    Integration: Connecting the front-end and back-end, integrating third-party services and APIs.

4. Testing

    Functional Testing: Ensure all features work as intended.
    Usability Testing: Evaluate the site's ease of use and user experience.
    Performance Testing: Check the site's speed, load times, and responsiveness.
    Security Testing: Identify and fix vulnerabilities.

5. Deployment

    Server Setup: Configure the web server and environment.
    Domain Configuration: Set up the domain name and DNS settings.
    Launch: Make the website live and accessible to users.

6. Maintenance and Updates

    Bug Fixes: Address any issues that arise post-launch.
    Performance Monitoring: Continuously monitor and optimize performance.
    Content Updates: Regularly update content to keep the site relevant.
    Feature Enhancements: Add new features and functionalities as needed.


1- Differentiate the terms Internet and Web.
    
    ** Internet is the global network of interconnected computers and servers that 
       Communicate using standardized protocols (like TCP/IP).

    ** The Web is a system of interlinked hypertext documents and multimedia content 
       accessed via the internet using web browsers.


2- An effective process model based on Software Engineering principles can help
   to follow a systematic approach especially for a website populated by
   framework activities.

   ** An effective process model in web engineering involves stages
   like requirement analysis, planing, design, implementation, 
   testing, deployment, and maintenance. This systematic approach 
   ensures user requirements are met, project timelines and 
   resources are managed, high-quality code is maintained, and the
   website is continuously improved for better performance and 
   user satisfaction. 



( An external: 

    Agile model
        ** The agile process model encourages continuous iterations 
        of development and testing. Each incremental part is 
        developed over an iteration, and each iteration is designed
        to be small and manageable so it can be completed within 
        a few weeks.
)

3- Client-Server Architecture:
    
    ** The client-server architecture involves clients (devices/
    software) requesting services/resources from servers (powerful 
    computers). Client initiate requests (e.g. HTTP), servers process
    these requests, generate responses, and send them back. This 
    model supports centralized resource management, scalability, 
    maintenance, and security, crucial for the functionality of the 
    World Wide Web.

Question 3

1) Web development is evolving at very fast. New website technologies are 
   being discovered regularly as developers explore new ways of innovation
    a) List and briefly explain at least three latest web development tools
       used in front-end and back-end web development.

    
** 1) React.js (Front-End)
    --  A JavaScript library for building reusable UI 
        components and efficient single-page applications.

** 2) Node.js (Back-End)
    --  A JavaScript runtime for building fast, scalable 
        sever-side applications using a non-blocking I/O
        model.

** 3) Docker (Both Front-End and Back-End)

    --  A containerization tool that packages applications with
        dependencies for consistent deployment and scalability.


    b)  Describe four (4) potential website attacks and the 
        suitable solutions you may take to get rid of it. 

    1. SQL Injection 

        ** Attackers inject malicious SQL code into input 
        fields, gaining unauthorized access to the database.

        ** Solution
        Use parameterized queries and prepared statements to 
        validate and sanitize user inputs.

    2.  Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

        ** Attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages,
        which execute in the web browser of users who view the
        page.

        ** Solution 
        Sanitize and escape user inputs and use 'Content 
        Security Policy (CSP)' to restrict the execution 
        of untrusted scripts. 

    3.  Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

        ** Attackers trick users into performing unintended 
        actions on a website where they are authenticated. 

        ** Solution
        Use anti-CSRF tokens and ensure that state-changing
        requests require these tokens to verify the request's 
        legitimacy. 

    4. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)

        ** Attackers overwhelm a website with a flood of 
        traffic, making it unavailable to legitimate users.

        ** Implement rate limiting, use DDoS protection 
        services like Cloudflare, and configure firewall to 
        filter out malicious traffic.

3)  Poorly optimized website performance is overwhelmed with a 
    number of issues. As a web developer, define a five (5) 
    important points you should follow to increase performance 
    of your website.

    1. Optimize Image: Compress and resize images to reduce 
    load times without compromising quality.

    2. Minimize HTTP Requests: Reduce the number of files 
    (CSS, JavaScript, images) needed to load a page by 
    combining or minifying them.(Minifying them = ඒවා කුඩා කිරීම)

    3. Use Caching: Implement browser and server-side caching
    to store frequently accessed data, reducing load times for
    returning users. 

    4. Implement Content Delivery Network (CDN): Use a CDN to 
    distribute content across multiple servers worldwide,
    speeding up content delivery to users. 

    5. Optimize Code: Minimize and clean up HTML, CSS and 
    JavaScript code to improve loading speed and reduce file 
    sizes. 


4. Frameworks have become an essential part of web 
development, as the standards of web applications are always
rising, so does the complexity of the technology needed.
Briefly explain about Vue.js and the different methods we use
to create webpages.

    Methods to Create Webpages with Vue.js

    1. Direct CDN Integration: Quickly add Vue.js to our
    webpage by including it directly from a CDN (Connect 
    Delivery Network) using a '<script>' tag.

    2. NPM Installer: Use Node Package Manger (NPM) to install
    Vue.js in our project, which is useful for more complex 
    applications with a build system 

    3. Vue CLI: Create a Vue.js project with a full 
    development environment using Vue CLI, which provides tools
    like hot-reloading and a built-in server.

    4. Single File Components (SFCs): Use '.vue' files to 
    define components, combining HTML, JavaScript, and CSS in a
    single file for modular development. 

    5. Component Libraries: Leverage Vue.js component 
    libraries like Vuetify or BootstrapVue to quickly build 
    responsive and styled UIs.


5. Networking technology has evolved significantly over the 
years as demands on Ethernet and Wi-Fi have tremendously 
increased. 

    a. Explain the three (3) main types of communication in 
    networking.

    b. Explain difference between physical and logical 
    addresses.



    a) Three Main Types of Communication in Networking:
        
        1. Unicast:  Communication between a single sender and 
        a single receiver.

        2. Broadcast: Communication from one sender to all 
        devices in a network. 

        3. Multicast: Communication from one sender to multiple
        specific receivers. 

    
    b) Difference Between Physical and Logical Addresses:

        *|* Physical Address: Also known as MAC address, it is
        unique identifier assigned to network interfaces for 
        communication on the physical network segment.


        *|* Logical Address: Also know as IP address, it is 
        assigned to devices on a network for identifying them 
        in a logical manner, used for routing across different
        networks. 


6. List the seven layers of the OSI model.

    'Open System Interconnections' = OSI 

    1. Physical Layer
    2. Data Link Layer 
    3. Network Layer 
    4. Transport Layer 
    5. Session Layer
    6. Presentation Layer
    7. Application Layer
