# EEI4362 â€“ Object Oriented Design  

Welcome to **EEI4362 â€“ Object Oriented Design**, a course in the BSE Programme at the Open University of Sri Lanka.  
This course introduces the fundamental concepts of **object-oriented design and programming**, focusing on abstraction, modularity, reusability, and software design principles.

## ðŸŽ¯ Programme Learning Outcomes (PLOs) Addressed  
- **PLO1**: Apply software engineering theory, principles, tools, processes, and fundamentals of computer science and mathematics to the development and maintenance of complex, scalable software systems.  
- **PLO2**: Identify, formulate, research literature, conduct investigations, and solve complex problems to provide valid conclusions using research methods.  
- **PLO3**: Design systems, components, or processes that meet specified needs and experiment with prototypes.  
- **PLO4**: Create, select, and apply appropriate techniques, resources, and tools to software engineering activities.  
- **PLO7**: Demonstrate broad knowledge of ethical responsibilities and professional standards.  
- **PLO10**: Communicate effectively on complex engineering activities with the engineering community and society at large (reports, design documentation, presentations, clear instructions).  
- **PLO12**: Engage in independent and lifelong learning in the broad context of technological change.
